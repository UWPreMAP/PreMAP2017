# Writing Assignment 4.5: Keeping up with the News

**Due: Wed, Oct 18**

An exciting discovery has been announced today on the detection of a neutron star-neutron star merger via gravitational waves! Read the [astrobites article](https://astrobites.org/2017/10/16/multi-messenger-observations-of-a-binary-neutron-star-merger/) (**not** the actual Journal article, unless you want to) and write a short (~1/2 page) summary of this new finding. In particular, make sure to state what the objects at play are, what the finding is, why it's exciting, and how it changes or enhances our knowledge of element production in the Universe.
