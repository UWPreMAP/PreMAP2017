# Writing 3: Impostor Thoughts

Many people will have what are known as "impostor thoughts" (sometimes referred to as "the impostor phenomenon" or "impostor syndrome") in their time at UW. We want you to know what these feelings are, so you can identify them if and when you come across them.

### Reading

Read this [introduction on the impostor phenomenon](http://staff.washington.edu/bmmorris/docs/Impostor_syndrome_Geek_Feminism_Wiki.pdf) from [Geek Feminism Wiki](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) to learn what the impostor phenomenon is. 

### Writing

Reflect on your reading about the impostor phenomenon and your personal experiences. If you can, write down any impostor thoughts you can remember having. **You will not turn this writing assignment in,** no one will read the writing that you do for this assignemnt. This writing assignment is strictly to get you thinking about your impostor thoughts, and the act of putting thoughts to paper can help crystalize your thinking. Again - this writing is for you, and only for you.
